# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-06-15 — Step 3: Sound block — expanded to 25 sounds

- **`content/soundAlert.js`:** replaced 3-branch if-else with `SOUND_DEFS` dispatch table (25 entries). Added `freqEnd` support to `playSoundConfig`: if a tone descriptor has `freqEnd`, oscillator frequency ramps linearly from `freq` to `freqEnd` over the tone duration using `setValueAtTime` + `linearRampToValueAtTime`. `getSoundTones()` now delegates to `SOUND_DEFS[soundId] || SOUND_DEFS['default']`. New sounds: bell, deep, high, click, ding, sonar, low, blip, wood, double, notify, drop, triple, alarm, fanfare, sparkle, sweep_up, sweep_down, chord, dial, burst, error.
- **`popup/popup.html`:** `<select id="popup-sound-select">` expanded from 3 to 25 `<option>` elements.
- **`popup/popup.js`:** `popupGetSoundTones()` replaced with `POPUP_SOUND_DEFS` dispatch table (identical 25 configs). `previewSound()` updated to handle `freqEnd` the same way as `playSoundConfig`.

---

### 2026-06-11 — Step 3: Sound block wired (persistence + preview)

- **`utils/storage.js`:** removed `SOUND_MUTED: 'soundMuted'`; added `VOLUME: 'soundVolume'` (number 0–100, default 70) and `SOUND_ID: 'soundId'` (string, default `'default'`).
- **`content/soundAlert.js`:** refactored. `getSoundTones(soundId, startTime)` — pure function, returns tone descriptors for `'default'` / `'soft'` / `'sharp'`. `playSoundConfig(soundId, gainPeak)` — async, resumes AudioContext, schedules oscillators. `playAlert()` — reads `VOLUME` + `SOUND_ID` from storage; returns early if `VOLUME === 0`; scales gain as `VOLUME / 100`. No more `SOUND_MUTED`.
- **`popup/popup.html`:** wrapped `<select>` and new replay `<button>` in `.popup-sound-select-row` div. New element: `id="popup-sound-replay"`, `data-testid="popup-sound-replay"`, `aria-label="Preview sound"`.
- **`popup/popup.css`:** added `.popup-sound-select-row` (flex row) and `.popup-sound-replay` (28×28 px icon button, green on hover) styles.
- **`popup/popup.js`:** Sound block fully wired. On open: reads `soundVolume` + `soundId` from storage, sets slider and dropdown (defaults: 70 / `'default'`). Slider writes on `change` (released, not every `input`). Dropdown writes on `change` then plays preview. Replay button plays preview of current selection at current volume. `previewSound(soundId, volume)` — mirrors `soundAlert.js` configs exactly (same `getSoundTones` logic) using a popup-local `AudioContext`. Live sync via `chrome.storage.onChanged`.

---

### 2026-06-11 — Step 3: Tab Alert wired

- **`utils/storage.js`:** added `TAB_ALERT: 'tabAlert'` to `STORAGE_KEYS`.
- **`content/tabAlert.js`** (new): `flashTabAlert()` — async, reads `STORAGE_KEYS.TAB_ALERT`; if enabled, swaps favicon to an orange "!" canvas icon and blinks the document title with "🔔 " prefix at 750 ms intervals for 10 s total. `stopTabAlert()` restores title and favicon; called automatically on `visibilitychange` (user focuses tab) or after duration. Both functions exposed on `window.__EXT_DEBUG`. No `.click()` calls.
- **`manifest.json`:** `content/tabAlert.js` inserted after `content/soundAlert.js`, before `content/detailOpener.js`.
- **`content/content.js`:** `flashTabAlert()` called in `orchestratorTick()` after `playAlert()` when new loads are found (`result.newCount > 0` branch). Not awaited — fire-and-forget is fine since the blink runs on its own timer.
- **`popup/popup.js`:** Tab Alert toggle wired alongside Night Mode. Reads `tabAlert` on DOMContentLoaded, writes on `change`, synced live via `chrome.storage.onChanged`.

---

### 2026-06-11 — Step 3: Night Mode wired (clean implementation)

- **`utils/storage.js`:** added `NIGHT_MODE: 'nightMode'` to `STORAGE_KEYS`.
- **`content/nightMode.js`** (new): CSS-class-toggle approach — `ensureNightStyle()` injects `<style id="ext-night-mode-style">` once (idempotent); `applyNightMode(on)` toggles `html.ext-night` class. All dark rules are scoped to `html.ext-night`, so toggling off instantly reverts to Amazon's original styles. Header preserved via `header, [role="banner"], nav[role="navigation"]` forced back to `#1a5c38`. Own sidebar (`#ext-sidebar`) and inline panel (`#ext-inline-panel`) re-asserted to their original colours at high specificity. `initNightMode()` reads storage on load; `chrome.storage.onChanged` keeps it live. `window.__EXT_DEBUG.toggleNight` exposed for console testing. No `.click()` calls.
- **`manifest.json`:** `content/nightMode.js` inserted after `utils/storage.js`, before `content/refreshManager.js`.
- **`popup/popup.js`:** Night Mode toggle wired — reads `nightMode` on DOMContentLoaded, writes on `change`, stays live via `chrome.storage.onChanged`. All other controls remain unwired.

---

### 2026-06-11 — Night Mode wiring fully reverted

Night Mode went through four CSS iterations (per-selector overrides → root invert → invert + tweaks → direct color overrides) but all had live-site conflicts (Amazon top header colour, invert side-effects). Entire Night Mode wiring reverted to UI-BUILT state pending a clean reimplementation.

- **Deleted:** `content/nightMode.js`
- **`manifest.json`:** removed `content/nightMode.js` from `content_scripts.js` array
- **`utils/storage.js`:** removed `NIGHT_MODE: 'nightMode'` from `STORAGE_KEYS`
- **`popup/popup.js`:** restored to intentionally inert (no DOMContentLoaded, no storage access)
- **`docs/UI_ELEMENTS.md`:** `popup-night-mode` status reverted to NOT wired
- **`docs/BACKLOG.md`:** Night Mode reverted from DONE → UI-BUILT; note added on correct approach (direct color overrides, not invert())

### Session 2026-06-11 — Sidebar redesign + Popup redesign + Bug fixes

#### content/sidebar.js — play/pause + scanline
- Removed: old `ext-btn-toggle` text button (Start / Stop).
- Added: `ext-playpause` pill control (SVG play ↔ pause icons). Visual state driven entirely by `container[data-running]` attribute + CSS selectors — no JS toggling class names. Click calls `toggleRunning()` which writes `STORAGE_KEYS.RUNNING` to storage (single source of truth). Keyboard: Enter / Space.
- Added: `ext-scanline` div at bottom edge of bar. CSS-only animation (`extScan` keyframe) runs while `container[data-running="true"]`. Speed linked to refresh interval via CSS custom property `--ext-scan-dur` set by `applyScanSpeed(speedSec)` (formula: `speedSec * 0.7`, clamped 0.5s..4s). `prefers-reduced-motion` disables animation.
- Added: `applyScanSpeed()` helper called on slider input AND on `chrome.storage.onChanged` for `STORAGE_KEYS.SPEED` (popup or other source changes speed → scanline updates live).
- `chrome.storage.onChanged` listener now handles both `STORAGE_KEYS.RUNNING` and `STORAGE_KEYS.SPEED`.

#### popup/popup.html + popup/popup.css + popup/popup.js — full redesign (UI only)
- Removed from popup: "Active" toggle, refresh-speed slider, "Loads visible" / "Last refresh" status fields. Run/speed control lives only in the sidebar now.
- New popup layout — two sections: **Display & Alerts** and **Load Board Filters**.
- Display & Alerts controls (UI built, NOT wired): Night Mode toggle, Tab Alert toggle, Sound block (volume slider + sound selector dropdown), Price Surge Alert toggle + threshold number input.
- Load Board Filters controls (UI built, NOT wired): Hide Promoted & Starting Soon toggle, Hide Similar Matches toggle.
- Footer: Reset to defaults button (NOT wired).
- `popup.js` is intentionally inert — no DOMContentLoaded handler, no storage access. Placeholder for Step 3 wiring.

#### content/detailOpener.js — scroll-before-click fix
- Bug: `elementFromPoint` returned null for new loads scrolled below the viewport (y > window.innerHeight). Fix: call `el.scrollIntoView({ block: 'center' })` (try/catch) after all three gates pass, then defer the point-resolve + click to `setTimeout(..., 250)`. Return true optimistically after scheduling. All safety checks (null, isForbiddenElement, el.contains fallback) run inside the timeout with the post-scroll rect.

#### content/detailOpener.js — earlier fix (same session)
- Replaced `dispatchRealisticClick` synthetic event sequence with `document.elementFromPoint` approach. Point biased left (30% width, 50% height) to avoid the Book button. Two additional safety gates on resolved target.

#### content/inlinePanel.js — multiple fixes and features
- `readSheetData` returns `{ header, segments }` (segmented model). Segments parsed from `.load-expander` blocks.
- Equipment text: regex `/\d+'\s*Trailer/` on normalized `.css-1cbogyo` text. Load type (Live/Drop/Preloaded): regex `Trailer\s+(Live|Drop|Preloaded)/i` on same block. Both set in one pass.
- Per-segment stop dedup by `arrival|departure` time key (fresh `seen` object per segment). Stops with missing times always kept.
- `buildPanelElement`: single-segment loads render the table directly (no accordion); two+ segments get collapsible grey headers (collapsed by default).
- Added `waitForSheet(callback)`: polls every 50ms (max 1500ms) until `#selected-work-sheet` contains `.load-expander`, then fires callback. Used by `initManualToggle` instead of fixed 800ms timeout.
- Added `initManualToggle()`: document-level click listener (bubbling); clicks on `.load-card` / `.load-card__selected` trigger `waitForSheet` → `showInlinePanel`. Clicking the same card again removes the panel (toggle off). `isForbiddenElement` guard on `ev.target`. Double-init guard via `window.__extManualToggleInit`. NOT auto-called from this file.
- `currentPanelCard` module-level variable tracks which card owns the current panel.
- CSS: `table-layout:fixed`, column widths 40/20/20/20%, `word-break:break-word`. Scanline gap removed (`margin: 0 0 12px 0`). Segment header uses `justify-content:space-between`, no `margin-left:auto` on arrow.

#### content/content.js — wiring + orchestrator fixes
- `initManualToggle()` called after `buildSidebar()` on page load.
- `startOrchestrator()` now fires `orchestratorTick().then(scheduleNextTick)` — first tick is immediate on Start, no initial delay.
- After new loads found: `openTopNewLoad` return value captured; if `autoOpen && opened`, `sleep(800)` then `showInlinePanel(result.newLoads[0]._element)` in try/catch. Auto-stop (storage.set RUNNING false + stopOrchestrator) happens AFTER the panel renders.

#### content/loadParser.js — green-highlight cards fix
- `parseLoads()` selector updated to: `div.load-card, div.load-card__selected, div.wo-card-header--highlighted`. Amazon highlights new loads with `wo-card-header--highlighted` before the user clicks them; without this fix they were invisible to the detector.

#### content/highlighter.js — match Amazon's highlight color
- `.ext-new-load` rule changed to `background-color: rgb(182, 227, 255) !important` (matches Amazon's own new-load highlight). Outline/box-shadow removed.

#### manifest.json
- `content/inlinePanel.js` added to `js` array after `detailOpener.js`, before `sidebar.js`.
